Broad InnerSource adoption is an example of a competency change.
Some competencies (in this example InnerSource) should be upleveled across the company.

Here are the roles involved in running a program for company-wide change in competency.

| **Driver** | This person is enabled by the CTO to drive improvement in the competency across the company. |
| **VP** | Works with the CTO directly.  These people know and believe that the CTO is enabling the competency program driver. |
| **Champion** | Each VP has at least one champion.  The VP enables this person to drive improvement in the competency across their area. |
| **Team Leader** | People in leadership/influence position on an individual team. Could be engineering/solution/scrum manager, etc. |

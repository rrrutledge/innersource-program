This page describes a launch plan for InnerSource

People and projects are interested in the idea of InnerSource, but aren't sure where to start.

We will gather a half-dozen or so projects that are interested in being run as InnerSource and launch them together.
The launch will include:

## Visibility

We will create a website that has a listing of all InnerSource projects.
Each project entry will show:

* Project name
* Problem it's trying to solve
* Technology requirements
* Chat channel
* Meetup info
* Git repo
* Documentation

This listing is ideally an InnerSource portal, but may start as aÂ wiki page.

## Reporting

Once each month we will report for each project the count of following interactions (both total and unique):

* Engagement in chat channel (reaction or text).
* Attendance at meetups.
* Project reuse.
* Code contributions.

## Structure

In order to make the system easy to engage in (both hosts and guests), we will make templates for meetups, docs, channel, and backlog.

## Initial Publicity

We will meet with the leadership staff of each business unit to tell them about the initial set of projects and to ask them to buy in to the plan for ongoing support.

## Ongoing Support

We will look for an InnerSource evangelist from each business unit.
The group of evangelists will meet once each month to review KPIs, learn of new InnerSource projects, make plans to improve, and report on assignments.
Each evangelist reports on InnerSource in their business unit leadership meeting once each quarter.

The group of people driving InnerSource projects will meet monthly to retro on how things are going and to make plans to improve the practice of InnerSource at WellSky.
